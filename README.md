# SECTION 1: VALUES AND VARIABLES

``` 
- From the above exapmle: 
- ```var``` is a statement which declares a variable in javaScript.
- ```MyName``` is a variavle name.
- ```'Sunny Raj'``` is the value.
- Variables are containers for storing information. Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable: ```var MyName```; 

#### RULES FRO GIVING VARIABLE NAME
- The first character must be a letter or an underscore```_``` or Dollar```$```. 
```
    var MyName = 'Sunny Raj';
    var $MyName = 'Sunny Raj';
    var _MyName = 'Sunny Raj';
```    
- You cant use a number as the first character ```var 1MyName = 'Sunny Raj';```
